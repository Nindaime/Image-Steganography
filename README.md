# Image-Steganography
Image Steganography, a process of concealing information in an image as the carrier medium, such that only end-users with the encryption and decryption cypher can access the hidden information. It employs PRNG and LSB algorithm for the encoding and decoding of the steganographic image.

This solution is written in Java to perform Image Steganography using Least Significant Bit (LSB) method.
